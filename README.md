DESCRIPTION:
This project implements a Bluetooth-based home automation system using an Arduino UNO. The aim is to control home appliances wirelessly through a smartphone using simple Bluetooth commands. Devices like lights or fans are simulated using LEDs connected to the Arduino. In real hardware, the HC-05 Bluetooth module receives commands from a mobile app, while in the Tinkercad simulation, the Serial Monitor is used to emulate this Bluetooth communication. The Arduino reads these commands—such as 'A', 'a', 'B', and 'b'—and accordingly turns the connected LEDs ON or OFF. This setup showcases the basic principle behind smart home automation, providing a low-cost and beginner-friendly way to understand wireless control of electronic devices
